My Little Cat

My little cat, so soft and sweet,
With tiny paws and dancing feet.
She purrs and plays the whole day through,
With eyes so bright, like drops of dew.

She curls up close when night is near,
A fluffy friend so warm and dear.
Oh, little cat, you bring me cheer,
My furry love, forever here!
